port to coffeescript
add tbody element
support m x n sudoku
allow puzzles to be generated of varying difficulty
add unit tests (qunit?)
show solution in a different colour instead of user input
improve performance, particularly for pathological: ..............3.85..1.2.......5.7.....4...1...9.......5......73..2.1........4...9
(currently 0.914s for test case, 8.4s for pathological on my system)

add eggtimer functionality for solving
detect when there are multiple solutions

measure whether not having a @get and @set has improved Chrome performance

better heuristics for performance:
e.g. detect when other rows already have value X, so this row must have X in this position
